<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>The course requires the attendance of course lectures and practical lab demonstration. 
          Out of class work will be assigned each week, as will out of class preparation for classes. 
          Students are expected to demonstrate knowledge, understanding and proficiency in the subject 
          matter by successfully completing written and lab assignments and written and/or practical tests.</p>
<p>A grade of C or better is required to successfully pass this class.</p>
<h3>Required/Recommended Textbook Materials, Supplies, etc.</h3>
            <ul>
        		<li>No Textbook</li>
		   		<li>USB Thumb Drive </li>
		    	<li>Pencil&#47;Pen and Paper</li>
        	</ul>         
       
<h3>Instructional Methodology</h3>
<p>This class is being taught as a hybrid course.</p>
<p>In order to better provide students a convenient time to take the class, additional instructional 
           materials will be available online. The instructional methodology will include the students completing 
           weekly reading assignments in the text and the additional instructional material included in the online 
           presentations, taking tests, working on a group class presentation, preparing Work Ethics exercises and 
           completing a course portfolios of all work completed. The portfolio and reflection statement to be 
           included with the portfolio allow the student to reflect on their work/efforts in the learning environment. 
           Assignments will be sent to the instructor via email or turned into the instructor directly. Communication 
           with the students will be continual as required and will be via email or during class time. Additional help 
           will be available to students’ if needed outside of class. The classroom and lab room will be made available 
           for student use at times other than scheduled class time.</p>
<p>There will be 3 or 4 regular tests, homework/classwork, and a final exam. The regular tests count for 40% of 
           your grade. The final exam will count for 20% of you grade. The homework/classwork will count for 30% of your 
           grade. The remaining 10% will be discretionary points. Nothing will be made up without a legitimate excuse.  
           The final exam will not be made up.</p>
<p>Immediate feedback for your code will be given via the HTML and CSS validators!</p>

<p>Homework Assignments&#58; All assignments are on the schedule and are due at 
           the end of the week in which each assignment is scheduled.</p>
<p>For credit to be given for the these assignments, they <strong>must</strong> include the following information: student name, 
           class ID (i.e. CIST 1601), and chapter number. E-mailed assignments must include the same information in the subject area.</p>
<p>You are expected to read each assigned chapter prior to the lecture!</p>
<p>Weekly homework and laboratory assignments can only be handed immediately <strong>BEFORE or AFTER</strong> lecture begins the 
           following week.</p>
<p>Make sure your <strong>name, class ID &#40;i.e. CIST 1001&#41;, and exercise number</strong> appear in the upper-left corner. 
           If an exercise has multiple sheets, then staple them together. Do not staple different assignments together. 
           Disorganized assignments &#40;Pages out of order, mislabeled, unreadable, etc.&#41; will receive a grade of zero. 
           If there are multiple sheets are to be handed in, then sequence them according to the order you were told to print them 
           in the exercise.</p>                 
<h3>Attendance&#47;Make-up Work Policy</h3>
<p>The attendance policy is set forth in the North Georgia Technical College Student Handbook. I expect you to attend every class, 
           arrive on time, and <strong>stay until I dismiss the class. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in the student 
           being dropped from the course. The student is encouraged to refer to the Student Handbook for further information regarding 
           the "Drop" Policy.</strong></p>
<p>Students anticipating a problem complying with the attendance policy should contact the instructor in advance or provide 
           notification as soon as possible, the preferred method to do this is via <strong>Email. Word of mouth by a third party is NOT 
           acceptable for absences. It is the responsibility of the student to arrange for make-up work at the convenience of the 
           instructor. Nothing will be made up without a legitimate excuse. The final exam will not be made up.</strong></p> 
<p>Using the Internet while lecture is taking place will result in a loss of one letter grade: a second instance will result 
           in a loss of two letter grades, therefore, THE USE OF THE INTERNET, CHAT LINES, AND E-MAIL DURING THIS CLASS LECTURE
           TIME IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED!! NO EXCEPTIONS!!</p>
    
<h3>Quality of Student Work</h3>
<p>Use of proper grammar, correct spelling, and writing principles are expected in all work. Full credit will not be given 
           for work that contains grammar or spelling errors. <strong>Copy and paste is not quality work, it is cheating and will be 
           graded accordingly!</strong></p>
<p>Any student caught <strong>cheating</strong> will receive a <strong>zero (0)</strong> for that assignment. If the student is caught 
           a second time they will be <strong>dropped from the class.</strong> </p>

<h3>Cheating Policy</h3>
<p>Students are expected to uphold the school’s standard of conduct relating to academic honesty. Students assume full 
           responsibility for the content and integrity of the academic work they submit. The guiding principle of academic integrity 
           shall be that a student's submitted work, examinations, reports, and projects must be that of the student's own work. 
           Students shall be guilty of violating the honor code if they&#58;
    <ul>
           		<li>Represent the work of others as their own</li>
				<li>Use or obtain unauthorized assistance in any academic work</li>
				<li>Give unauthorized assistance to other students</li>
                <li>Modify, without instructor approval, an examination, paper, record, or report for the purpose of obtaining 
                    additional credit</li>
                <li>Misrepresent the content of submitted work</li>
    </ul>
<p>The penalty for violating the honor code is severe. Any student violating the honor code is subject to receive a failing grade for 
           the course and will be reported to the Office of Student Affairs. If a student is unclear about whether a particular situation 
           may constitute an honor code violation, the student should meet with the instructor to discuss the situation.</p>
<p>For this class, it is permissible to assist classmates in general discussions of computing techniques. General advice and interaction 
           are encouraged. Each person, however, must develop his or her own solutions to the assigned homework and laboratory exercises. Students
           may not "work together" on graded assignments. Such collaboration constitutes cheating, unless it is a grouped assignment. A student 
           may not use or copy (by any means) another's work (or portions of it) and represent it as his/her own. If you need help on an 
           assignment, contact your instructor or the TA, not other classmates.</p>
    
<h3>Computer Use Policy</h3>
<p>The Computer Use Policy was given to you at the departmental orientation your first Semester as a student in the department. 
              A copy of the policy is in a pocket folder located at the front of each of the computer labs for your reference.</p>
              
<h3>Safety</h3>
    	<p>The safety procedures and rules are posted on the bulletin boards in the upstairs and downstairs hallways and at the front 
           of each of the classrooms.  Located in the same area is the evacuation plan.  The safety procedures are in the packet 
           of information that was given to you at the departmental orientation your first Semester as a student. Be sure to view the 
           <a href="main_files/DISASTER_DRILL_PROCEDURE.docx">disaster drill</a> information. </p>
