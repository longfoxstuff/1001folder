<h2>NORTH GEORGIA TECHNICAL COLLEGE</h2>

<h3>WORK ETHICS POLICY</h3>

<p>The Department of Technical
and Adult Education has established a statewide work ethics policy with
the assistance of business and industry in the state of
Georgia.&nbsp; Each technical institute/college will be utilizing
this policy.&nbsp; The policy is being marketed to business and
industry to request transcripts from graduates to check the work ethics
grades.&nbsp; Work Ethics is a major issue with business and
industry; therefore, it is very important to us. </p>

<p>There are ten work ethics traits and performance standards that will be
taught to you.&nbsp; As a student and worker, you are expected to
exhibit these in the classrooms and laboratories.&nbsp; On each of
the ten traits, students will begin with a grade of 2, which means
students have met expectations.&nbsp; Meeting expectations means
that you do what is expected of you.&nbsp; For someone to receive a
grade of 3 (exceptional), the student has to go above and beyond what
is expected.&nbsp; When a student does not exemplify what is
expected, a point will be deducted from one or more of the
traits.&nbsp; This means that you need improvement.&nbsp; At
this point, an exception form will be completed with an improvement
plan given to the student.&nbsp; If the student does not accomplish
the tasks of the plan, the student will not be able to regain the point
back to the overall grade of &ldquo;2&rdquo;.&nbsp; Also,
more points may be deducted.&nbsp; </p>
</div>
<p>The final Work Ethics grade will be determined by averaging all of the
class Work Ethics grades for one student.&nbsp; Grades will be
assigned based on the following scale:</p>
